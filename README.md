# StocksAngular Project
This project uses Angular as front-end for a stocks application where the user can search for stocks and have an autofill feature in the search bar. The user can also add stocks to their favorites as well as buy and sell stocks. The bought stocks are saved to the portfolio tab and the wallet is saved using local storage.

The back-end is implemented using NodeJS in the "app.js" and "apiCalls.js" files, using Finnhub API calls.
